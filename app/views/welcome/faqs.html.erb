<p class="faqs_text faqs_main_heading">How long will creating my account and campaign take?</p>

We provide tools, templates and tips to get a great program set up that fits your business goals, brand and voice.  And if you need any help setting up your program, we have a team that can help you get started <a href="/contact">(click here to send a request for help).</a></p>
<p class="faqs_text faqs_main_heading">How much does it cost to use Credvine?</p>
<p class="faqs_text">You can create your account and campaign for free. You only pay per referral, which means you don’t pay unless you’re getting exposure and new customers.  We believe our customers should pay for value received, not just for using our service! </p>
<p class="faqs_text faqs_main_heading">Can I change my campaign after I start it?</p>
<p class="faqs_text">Of course! You have complete control over your campaign, and you can modify your campaign at any time, making adjustments to your incentives, changing wording in your welcome and thank you messages, or extending your coupon expiry dates.  You also have the option to create and launch a new campaign, if you prefer - and we make it easy to see which campaign is active at any time. Just keep in mind that if you have advertised offering specific incentives for referrals, you’ll want to keep customers updated on any changes to what they’ll receive and what they can offer friends.</p>
<p class="faqs_text faqs_main_heading">Can’t I just do this myself?</p>
<p class="faqs_text">Sure, but it can be tough! We’ve spoken with many business owners who have tried to run their own referral programs manually - they all tell us that the manual tracking and following up becomes a real burden and in many cases has resulted in their program lapsing.  Keeping track of who referred who, remembering to follow up with thank you notes and gifts and even remembering to ask for referrals are some of the frustrations we’ve heard from business owners - and they say that doing this themselves in spreadsheets not only takes a lot of time and effort, but can also lead to mistakes and missed opportunities.</p>
<p class="faqs_text">
This is why we created credvine referrals - because we experienced these frustrations first hand and have worked with customers who’ve had the same issues.  We want to make the process of creating and managing a referral program easy and natural.  Something your customers are happy to participate in and something that works with the way you already do business, helping you grow your business sustainably without taking up a lot of your time.</p>
<p class="faqs_text faqs_main_heading">Do I really need to give away revenue?</p>
<p class="faqs_text">This is about quality referrals.  A credvine referral program helps your best customers spread the word to others like them.  They hand pick friends and associates who they think would benefit from what your business has to offer and then send a personalized referral suggesting they check you out. </p>
<p class="faqs_text">
Our program also focuses on connecting customers and business who can provide each other with real value - not discount seekers who are looking for the next opportunity to get 70% off.  We encourage businesses to offer a modest gift or discount or other value-added benefits like VIP service, upgrades or free add-ons.  These serve as a little extra incentive and are a way to say ‘thank you’ for checking out your business, but the primary driver of their visit remains personal recommendation from their friend of the great products and services you offer. </p>
<p class="faqs_text">
And keep in mind that compared with many other customer acquisition channels, from direct mail, to daily deals, to in-store promotions, to online advertising, credvine provides excellent value.  You get access to great long-term potential customers for a very modest acquisition cost.  And we also help you follow-up to maintain customer relationships and develop stronger loyalty and greater propensity for follow-on referrals.  </p>
